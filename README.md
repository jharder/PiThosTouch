# PiThosTouch
Raspberry Pi interface for Pithos, with touch in mind

This project aims to create an alternate interface for the Pithos Pandora project (https://github.com/pithos/pithos) that is meant to be used on a touch interface. 

The initial design will be meant for a 320x240 2.8" TFT resistive touch display (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1601) but may potentially evolve to support arbitrary display sizes and resolutions.

I will attach a HOWTO doc on how to implement the hardware once the software coding is complete.
